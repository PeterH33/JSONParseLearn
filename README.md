# JSONParseLearn
Learning to parse json. Day 60 challenge 100 days of swiftUI

This is a simple program to learn about the ins and outs of parsing json with xcode and swiftui. It pulls a json file from online and parses it into a core data object. There is not much point to this outside of learning and showing those systems in work.
